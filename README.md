# 🎬 Movie Recommender System (Lab Work)

This project implements two types of content-based recommender systems using movie data:

## 📌 Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Cosine Similarity Recommender
- Based on genre and lead studio
- Uses `CountVectorizer` and cosine similarity
- Recommends top 5 most and least similar movies

### ✅ Task 2: k-NN Classifier-Based Recommender
- Uses binary genre features to predict if a user likes a movie
- Models trained and evaluated using sklearn's KNeighborsClassifier
- Evaluates performance using accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix
